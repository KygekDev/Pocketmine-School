## What is PocketMine-MP?

PocketMine-MP is a software for running Minecraft: Bedrock Edition multiplayer servers. PocketMine-MP is one of the oldest Minecraft Bedrock server softwares which is still maintained. It is also one of the most well-known Minecraft Bedrock server sofwares besides the official Minecraft Bedrock Server by Mojang (usually known as "Bedrock Dedicated Server" or "BDS").

PocketMine-MP is written in the PHP programming language. PocketMine-MP has many advantages over the offical Minecraft Bedrock Server, such as plugins, more advanced features, and much more (we will discuss about it further in a later page). PocketMine-MP is also known to use less storage and memory (usually known as "RAM") while running compared to the offical Minecraft Bedrock Server.

PocketMine-MP is a perfect solution for running  Minecraft Bedrock servers with custom gameplays, such as Economy, PvP, Bedwars, and much more. One disadvantage on using PocketMine-MP is the lack of certain vanilla features and behaviors, such as mobs, blocks, items, world generations, and much more, unlike the offical Minecraft Bedrock Server. However, such disadvantages can usually be resolved using custom plugins.

PocketMine-MP is an open-source software. This means anyone can freely view the source code, make modifications and contribute. However, there are some important things to note before taking any actions to the PocketMine-MP source code itself. We will discuss about it further in a later page.

## Do I need PocketMine-MP?

Before continuing, we need to make sure you actually need the features of PocketMine-MP. You don't want to waste your time learning to use things you don't need, don't you?

Now, read and decide an answer (either "Yes" or "No") for each of the questions below:

1. Do you *need* a Minecraft server software which supports implementation of most custom gameplays (such as Economy, PvP, Bedwars, and much more) despite not having vanilla features and behaviors (such as mobs, blocks, items, world generations, and much more)?
2. Do you *really need* a Minecraft server sofware which uses memory and storage as minimal as possible?
3. Do you *need* a Minecraft server which have many advanced features and community support?
4. Do you also *need* a Minecraft server which can be run in Android devices?
5. Do you also *need* a Minecraft server which is easy to configure and easy to modify?

If all of the questions above answers "No", consider using the offical Minecraft Bedrock Server instead of PocketMine-MP.

If you're unsure what to answer, you can try using both PocketMine-MP and the offical Minecraft Bedrock Server before deciding what to use.

If most or all of the questions above answers "Yes", then PocketMine-MP is a right solution for you!
