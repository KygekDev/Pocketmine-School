## Why do we fork PocketMine School?

The orginal PocketMine School has been left unmaintained for over 6 months as of writing this page, **yet there are many changes to be made**. Forking PocketMine School also **gives us flexibility to add contents** without having to submit pull requests to the repository.

## Can I contribute to PocketMine School?

Until the original PocketMine School goes back maintained, **we do not recommend you to submit pull requests or issues in the original PocketMine School repository**. You can submit [pull requests](https://github.com/KygekTeam/Pocketmine-School/pulls) or [issues](https://github.com/KygekTeam/Pocketmine-School/issues) in this fork repository instead, which will be reviewed by KygekTeam staffs.

As soon as the orginal PocketMine School goes back maintained, **we will try submitting a pull request to the original repo unless TeamUltraSoft approves KygekTeam to be the new maintainer**.

<!-- TODO: Add tutorial for building and testing PocketMine School locally -->
